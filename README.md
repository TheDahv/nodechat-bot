#NodeChat-Bot

This is like [hubot's](http://hubot.github.com/) cousin who is more grouchy, does less stuff, and has a receding hair line.

It was created to work in tandem with [nodechat-server](https://github.com/TheDahv/nodechat-server).

It basically listens for people talking about it and then does some things if it understands what was said.

Oh, and we don't use coffeescript 'round here because we walk uphill both ways and we like it that way.

'We' is actually just me.
